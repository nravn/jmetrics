# Guiding principles

* Lossless metrics. You can't trust metrics that lose data.
* Easy to understand. So you can make clear decisions.
* Doesn't get in the way. Metrics, like logging, should be something that takes minimal lines of code.
* Works for everyone. Metrics should work with any volume of data.
